Welcome to the TruSender API! You can use our API to access TruSender API endpoints, which can get information on customers, events, email templates from your account.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right. For each API we have given the simple code samples which you can copy and paste it in your application to get the details about that api.

Run in Postman
We’ve created a Postman collection to make testing and working with our API simpler.<br/>
